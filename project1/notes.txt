1. You suggested that if no player can move, the game should end. The current endOfGame_o6o7 doesn't do this. Could be done by checking if null (playerMoves_o6o7 board player) && null (playerMoves_o6o7 (reverse board) (otherPlayer_o6o7 player))

2. Any ideas to improve the board evaluator? For instance, players pieces that have passed all of otherPlayers pieces could be worth more...
